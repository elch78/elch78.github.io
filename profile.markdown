## About Me

I am a software engineer with a strong DevOps mindset and **20 years of experience** in backend technology. I bring a
comprehensive skill set spanning architecture, clean code practices, automated testing, legacy code refactoring,
deployment pipelines, operations, and observability.

I firmly believe that Continuous Deliver i.e. TDD, feedback loops and a high degree of automation are essential not only
for delivering high-quality software but also for achieving high development efficiency. By continuously improving every
aspect of the codebase, I ensure that the software can be developed efficiently and sustainable.
